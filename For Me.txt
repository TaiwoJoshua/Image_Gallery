I made use of Mail for hosting on 000webhost because I do not have access to SMTP when hosting for free.
I changed my token because it is too random and changes already before mail is already sent
So it changes every minute now not second and I removed the random number too
New token - $token = md5(date('i')+123456789% 10); 
PHPMailer is working fine if you want to host on a paid website
